/**
 * This is the "old" physics system. The reason this package is named "old" <br>
 * is to not conflict with the new particle system that is in development. <br>
 * <br>
 * This particle system worked fine using the normal rendering system, but when using <br>
 * the <b>Camera</b> class the system didn't really work. <br>
 * The system had other flaws as well, it wasn't precise with different amounts of FPS <br>
 * which of course should never happen. <br>
 * <br>
 * Unless for testing, my suggestion is to not use any of the classes contained in this package <br>
 * and or marked with the @deprecated annotation.
